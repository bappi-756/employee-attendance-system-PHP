A simple web-based attendance system that allows employees to check in and out twice a day, and administrators to manage employees and view attendance records.

## Features

### Admin Panel
- Admin login system
- Create, edit, and delete employees
- View and filter attendance logs
- Dashboard with attendance statistics

### Employee Panel
- Login with ID and password
- Dashboard with profile and attendance summary
- Check-in and check-out functionality (morning and afternoon)
- View personal attendance history

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- Backend: PHP (Procedural)
- Database: MySQL

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or extract the files to your web server directory**

2. **Create the database**
   - Import the `database.sql` file into your MySQL database
   - This will create the required tables and a default admin user

3. **Configure the database connection**
   - Open `config/db_connect.php`
   - Update the database credentials if needed:
     ```php
     $host = "localhost";
     $username = "root";
     $password = "";
     $database = "attendance_system";
     ```

4. **Create uploads directory**
   - Make sure the `uploads` directory exists and is writable
   - This is where employee profile photos will be stored

5. **Access the system**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the project URL
   - Example: `http://localhost/attent/`

## Default Login Credentials
